# cloudDemo
Building an ecommerce site to be hosted on Azure and AWS, with K8s and Terraform. App built using RoR and React.

#1. **Setting Up the Development Environment**

1. **Ruby on Rails and React Setup**
   - Install Ruby, Rails, and Node.js (for React) on your computer.
   - Create a new Rails project: `rails new myapp --webpack=react`.
   - Ensure your Rails app is running locally and you can create a simple React component.

2. **Dockerize Your Application**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for both the Rails and React parts of your application.
   - Build your Docker images and test them locally.

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**

1. **Terraform Setup**
   - Install Terraform.
   - Write Terraform scripts to define your infrastructure for both AWS and Azure.
   - This should include your network setup, VMs, load balancers, etc.

2. **Testing Infrastructure Locally**
   - You can test your Terraform scripts locally using Terraform CLI.

### 3. **Kubernetes (K8s) for Container Orchestration**

1. **K8s Setup**
   - Understand the basics of Kubernetes.
   - Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for your application.
   - You can test your setup locally using Minikube or Docker Desktop's Kubernetes feature.

2. **K8s Scaling**
   - Ensure your Kubernetes setup includes auto-scaling based on traffic.

### 4. **Deploying to Cloud (AWS & Azure)**

1. **AWS Deployment**
   - Use Terraform to deploy your infrastructure to AWS.
   - Deploy your Docker containers to AWS using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

2. **Azure Deployment**
   - Similarly, use Terraform to deploy to Azure.
   - Deploy your Docker containers to Azure using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### 5. **Domain Configuration and SSL Setup**

1. **Subdomain Setup**
   - Configure `app.spagno.li` to point to your load balancer in the cloud (AWS/Azure).
   - Ensure you have an SSL certificate for HTTPS.

### 6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - You can use tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or Azure Pipelines.
   - Set up a pipeline that takes your code from repository to deployment automatically.

### 7. **Testing and Monitoring**

1. **Post-Deployment**
   - Conduct thorough testing of your application in the cloud.
   - Set up monitoring and logging (using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-specific tools).

### 8. **Documentation and Maintenance**

1. **Documentation**
   - Document your architecture, setup, and deployment procedures.
   - This is crucial for maintenance and possible scaling.

2. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Regularly update your application and infrastructure for security and performance improvements.

### Additional Notes

- This is a simplified guide. Each step can be quite complex and may require additional research and learning.
- Consider security best practices at each step, especially when deploying to the cloud and managing databases.
- Be aware of the costs associated with cloud services and Kubernetes usage.
